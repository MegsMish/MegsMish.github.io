desc: This was a course project for Machine Learning course. This project aims to analyse and predict the reception of comments on the New York Times articles by the New York Times community. It also aims to analyse the features that play a key role in determining the reception, which is indicated by the number of recommendations a comment receives. Some of the main applications of this work would be to automate the process of editorsâ€™ selection for the comments as well as to highlight the comments which shall potentially be the top comments on the given article. We also examine the feasibility of online prediction of the number recommendations on the comments. The exploratory data analysis was performed and new, innovative features were engineered to help the cause. Various models were used and comparison of performance is reported.

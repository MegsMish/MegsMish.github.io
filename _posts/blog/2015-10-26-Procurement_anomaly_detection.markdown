desc: Developed models to identify high risk behavior with the universityâ€™s procurement cards and other procurement methods. Various anomaly detetion methods such as  Local Outlier Factor, Isolation Forest, K-Means clustering and Statistical approaches were used for detecting fraudulent transactions. I served as the project lead (part of Penn Data Science group) under Eric Bradlow, Vice-Dean of Analytics at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.

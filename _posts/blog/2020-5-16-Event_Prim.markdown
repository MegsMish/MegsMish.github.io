desc: Constructing a formalized ontology of event types using a top down approach . Given the semantic representations that are to be taken into considerations for a new knowledge base, similar sentences describing the event are found from an unlabeled-unstructured corpora. The semantic roles and participants for each of those event types are extracted to build this formalized ontology. All annotations there within will be used for classification and semantic role-labeling tasks. The project is in collaboration with the University of Colorado Boulder and under the guidance of Dr. Chris Callison-Burch (University of Pennsylvania) and Dr. Martha Palmer (University of Colorado Boulder).

desc: Arduino placed on each dustbins acts as a node and reports to the Raspberry Pi which acts as a central node. The central node applies Travelling Salesman Problem and creates a graph containing the shortest path to collect all the filled dustbins. Raspberry Pi is further connected to AWS IOT, which takes the data from each node and applies predictive algorithms to determine the number of dustbins required in different areas depending on the rate of filling of dustbins.

desc: Active learning targets to minimize the human annotation efforts by selecting examples for labeling. This project demonstrates the use active learning in order to identify Named Entities in sentences. The results of two Active Learning approaches, Query by Committee and Uncertainty sampling are tested and compared using various metrics to measure the uncertainty of a sentence. Conditional Random Field and Maximum-Entropy Classifier models were build for the Named Entity Recognition task on the CoNLL-2002/2003 dataset and  AUC (Area Under Curve) metric was used for evaluation. Uncertainty sampling with total token entropy gave the best performance.  Named entity recognition's are reliant on tagged data as it is domain specific. Therefore, results are also tested on a multi-lingual dataset to measure itâ€™s reproducibility.
